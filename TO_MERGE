=======
To clarify comments below - mst originally misread the point of the branch
There seems to be agreement that this branch should be marked as rejected,
and deleted when RT#73876 is resolved (which is a DBIC::SL issue, and the
ticket has been moved the the appropriate queue a while ago)
=======

I would propose that in fact this branch shouldn't test DBIC_TRACE - but
in order to be able to warn on redefinition of relationships we need to add
a '+foo' form for relationships. Possibly an env var to squelch the warning
until somebody can redo their code?

The warning is spurious as indicated in the RT ticket. Caelum said he will
fix it and never did anything.

This conceptually is not a DBIC problem
