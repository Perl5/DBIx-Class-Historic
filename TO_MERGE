I would propose that in fact this branch shouldn't test DBIC_TRACE - but
in order to be able to warn on redefinition of relationships we need to add
a '+foo' form for relationships. Possibly an env var to squelch the warning
until somebody can redo their code?

The warning is spurious as indicated in the RT ticket. Caelum said he will
fix it and never did anything.

This conceptually is not a DBIC problem
