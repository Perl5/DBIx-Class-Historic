=head1 DESCRIPTION

In L<DBIx::Class>, a user normally receives query results as instances of a
certain C<Result Class>, depending on the main query source.  Besides being
the primary "toolset" for interaction with your data, a C<Result Class> also
serves to establish source metadata, which is then used during initialization
of your L<DBIx::Class::Schema> instance.

Because of these multiple seemingly conflicting purposes, it is hard to
aggregate the documentation of various methods available on a typical
C<Result Class>. This document serves as a general overview of C<Result Class>
declaration best practices, and offers an index of the available methods
(and the Components/Roles which provide them).

=head1 INITIALIZATION METHODS

=head2 table_class

  __PACKAGE__->table_class('DBIx::Class::ResultSource::View')

The accessor holds the class name from which the result source instance of
this result class will be derived. If not specified defaults to
L<DBIx::Class::ResultSource::Table>.

=head2 table

  __PACKAGE__->table('artists');

See L<AUTHOR|DBIx::Class/AUTHOR> and L<CONTRIBUTORS|DBIx::Class/CONTRIBUTORS> in DBIx::Class
Instantiates a result source instance and sets its
L<name|DBIx::Class::ResultSource/name> to the supplied argument. If called
without arguments proxies to L<name|DBIx::Class::ResultSource/name>.
